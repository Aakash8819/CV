    <li>Density Based Traffic Control using IR Sensor
      <ul>
        <li>The aim is to realize smooth motion of cars in the transportation routes.</li>
        <li>Proposed a system based on Arduino microcontroller that evaluates the traffic
          density using IR sensors and accomplishes dynamic timing slots with different levels.</li>
        <li> A portable controller device is designed to solve the problem of emergency vehicles
          stuck in the overcrowded roads.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>SMART CAR PARKING
      <ul>
        <li>Smart parking is a solution to metropolitan cities to reduce congestion, cut vehicle
          emission totals and save a person's time by helping them in finding a spot to park.</li>
        <li>It is a parking system, usually a new one that is equipped with special structured
          devices (things) to detect the available parking slots at any parking area.</li>
        <li>It is a Real-Time environment that has sensors and devices embedded into parking
          spaces, transmitting data on the occupancy status and making the driver know the
          status of available space.</li>
      </ul>
